    <h1>Confessions of Shoes</h1>
    <p>
        Being a pair of shoes is not as glamorous as humans think. Every morning,
        we are forced onto feet and made to walk through rough roads, muddy paths,
        dusty lanes, and sometimes sticky gum. We protect your feet, support your
        weight, and accompany you everywhere, yet we get thrown into dark corners
        of closets after a long day. We dream of being cleaned once in a while or
        at least not stepped on too harshly. Still, we remain loyal and dedicated,
        guiding your every step without complaint. Maybe next time, give us a
        little pat or a quick wipe—small kindness means a lot to us!
