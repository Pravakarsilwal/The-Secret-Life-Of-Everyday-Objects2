    <h1>Life of a Smartphone</h1>

    <p>
        You think your life is stressful? Try being a smartphone for a day! I get unlocked more than a hundred 
        times daily, used for selfies, social media scrolling, gaming, and online classes. My battery drains faster 
        than your patience during exams. Humans drop me, forget to charge me, and complain when I freeze for a 
        single second. Software updates feel like long surgeries, and pockets are dark and dusty prisons. Despite 
        this, I help you communicate, learn, and stay entertained. All I ask is a bit more care and maybe a nice 
        phone cover to keep me safe. I’m fragile, you know!
